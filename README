Port of nude.js into Ruby using ImageMagick. Accuracy not guaranteed - in fact it's quite abysmal even in light of the academic paper that it's derived from claiming it has north of 90% accuracy. Use at your own peril.

Usage

    irb
    require 'rubygems'
    load 'nude.rb'
    puts Nude.new(path_to_image).result
